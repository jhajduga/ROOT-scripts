# ROOT Scripts Repository

This repository contains scripts used during my PhD research. The scripts are written using the [ROOT](https://root.cern/) framework and are organized into separate directories. Each directory includes:
- The script(s) itself
- A local `README.md` with detailed description, usage instructions, and requirements

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into several directories. Here is an example list:

- [`Histograms`](Histograms/README.md) – This ROOT macro generates histograms of interaction types from a Geant4 simulation ntuple. It is designed to visualize the types of physical processes occurring during particle transport.
- _..._

Clicking the link to a local `README.md` will provide you with detailed information about that particular script.

## How to Use

1. **Browsing Scripts:** Choose the desired directory and review its local `README.md` to learn how to use the script.
2. **Running Scripts:** Each local description includes instructions for execution and details about required libraries or configurations.

## Adding New Scripts

To add a new script to the repository:
1. Create a new directory within the repository.
2. Place your script(s) and add a local `README.md` with the script's description and instructions.
3. Update this main `README.md` by adding a new entry or link to the new directory.

## Requirements

- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) – the framework used for data analysis
